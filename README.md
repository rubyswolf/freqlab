## What is freqlab?

Most AI apps are trying to replace traditional music/audio creative flows (ie. suno and other exploitative gen-ai), I wanted to create something that genuinely assists their creative process instead of replacing it.

freqlab was built for producers and sound designers who aren't developers, but who have always dreamed of creating unique plugins for their projects.

### The Workflow

```
Describe → Build → Preview → Iterate → Publish
```

1. Create a plugin project and choose a template
2. Chat to describe what you want, Claude Code writes the Rust code
3. One-click build compiles your plugin
4. Hot reload lets you hear changes instantly - test with signals, samples, live input, or MIDI
5. Revert to any version if something breaks
6. Publish directly to your DAW

## Installation

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jamesontucker/freqlab/releases/latest) — the universal DMG works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

### Building from Source

git clone https://github.com/jamesontucker/freqlab.git
cd freqlab
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

Or build a release:

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

## Known Issues

### Unsigned Plugins

> [!WARNING]
> Plugins are unsigned, so macOS Gatekeeper may block them.

You may need to remove the quarantine flag (though this is already automated in the app):

```bash
xattr -cr /path/to/YourPlugin.clap
xattr -cr /path/to/YourPlugin.vst3
```

### Code Review

> [!CAUTION]
> An AI agent generates the plugin code. While templates include safety limiters, always review generated code before distributing. You're generating Rust, so make sure to understand what it's doing!

### Third-Party Assets

You are responsible for ensuring you have the proper rights and licenses for any assets you include in your plugins — fonts, images, samples, icons, etc. Do not use copyrighted or commercially-licensed materials without appropriate permissions.

## License

freqlab is licensed under the [PolyForm Shield License 1.0.0](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0/). See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

**What this means:**

- You can use, modify, and distribute freqlab
- You **cannot** use it to create a competing product or service

### Plugin Licensing

Plugins you create use [nih-plug](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug):

- **nih-plug framework** - ISC license
- **VST3 bindings** - GPL-3.0

**What this means for your plugins:**

- VST3 plugins must be GPL-3.0 (provide source on request)
- CLAP-only plugins have no such requirement
- You can sell plugins, but must share source if asked. But to be honest, just make them for yourself and share with your friends.
- If you want to actually sell plugins you should be hiring a developer or learning to code!
